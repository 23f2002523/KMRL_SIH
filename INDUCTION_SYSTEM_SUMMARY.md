# KMRL Trainset Induction Planning System - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Project Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive **AI-powered Trainset Induction Planning System** for KMRL (Kochi Metro Rail Limited) that solves the complex problem statement provided. The system transforms manual trainset induction planning into an algorithm-driven decision-support platform.

## 📋 Problem Statement Addressed

**Original Challenge**: KMRL needed to optimize trainset induction planning for 25 four-car trainsets with 6 interdependent decision variables:

1. **Fitness Certificates** - Safety compliance from Rolling-Stock, Signalling, Telecom departments
2. **Job Card Priorities** - IBM Maximo work order management and prioritization  
3. **Branding Exposure** - Advertiser SLA compliance and revenue protection
4. **Mileage Balancing** - Component wear equalization across bogie, brake-pad, HVAC
5. **Cleaning Schedules** - Deep-cleaning optimization with bay and manpower constraints
6. **Stabling Geometry** - Depot positioning and movement cost minimization

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Next.js 14.2.32 Frontend** - Modern React-based dashboard with real-time ML integration
2. **Python ML Backend** - 6 specialized machine learning models for each decision variable
3. **SQLite Database** - Train data storage with 57 trains and 228 trip records
4. **Multi-Objective Optimization Engine** - Combines all 6 models for comprehensive decision support
